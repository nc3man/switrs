    Purpose: dumps dictionary to CSV file

    Usage: dumpDictToCSV(dictList, csvFile, delimiter, header)

    Input:
        DictList- Dictionary of data. Each key points to a list of the same length
        csvFile - Name of CSV file to store the exploded structure, one column per
                key of dictList. For input later to Excel if desired.
        delimiter - Character used to uniquely separate the cells of the
                spreadsheet by row. This character must not exist in any
                of the string values contained in dictList or its keys.
        header  - list of keys in order for output columns. These must match the
                keys, but possibly in different order
        encoding - Specify encoding if some characters are not utf-8

    Output:
        The CSV file in cvsFile contains the dictionary data where the first
        row is a header line of dictionary keys for the columns.
